      This is About Us Page. I built this website with reactjs. You can search
      movies from an API, and select a movie to rate and save your ratings in a
      json DB. Also, you can create blogs. You can also remove any blog or
      rating that you have created by opening the details of blog/rating by
      clicking on individual previews in the home page.
